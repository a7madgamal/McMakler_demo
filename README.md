# Readme
A demo task for McMakler

## Installation
- "yarn install" to install dependencies
- "yarn start" to serve the project in development mode
- "yarn test" to run tests
- "yarn build" to generate a production version

## About the task

- I decided to go with create-react-app because the limited time didn't allow to re-invent the wheel 
- I sent an email explaining the use of data.json hack, However, I think the api fetching function should work fine if the cors error is fixed.
- I would use sass for style to make use of variables / nesting rules but due to the short time I decide to go with css as supporting sass / css modules with react would burn require some time to setup (I did it before however on more relaxed tasks!)
- I used precommit with prettier to cover 'Githooks' and 'Usage of linters'
- I wasn't sure how to get 'Kaufen' 'Mieten' status so I made a guess, normally I would ask for sure :D
# this is far from perfect on many levels. However, this is what I would improve if I had more time:
  - responsiveness of the ui (make use of bootstrap grid features, test the ui on different screen sizes...)
  - make the ui more pixel perfect, perfection takes time!
  - use less fixed (size, font-size) values
  - add subtle animations, hover effects...
  - add more tests to handle possible errors
  - even more if I had the time to think about it!

# I'm really looking forward for a detailed technical review of what you liked/didn't like about the result to be able to learn. Thanks in advance
